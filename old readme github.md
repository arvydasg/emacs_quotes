# quotes

A place where I store all the quotes/sayings/thoughts that I gathered during my years of travelling.

I prefer to have them in one place, with some structure so that I can find things in case I ever need them.

Also it is easier to share them with others through a website rather than a google drive document.

And since I am learning the ins and outs of emacs, I thought I will give it a try and create a website using emacs and some external themes. (https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes).

Also, for my own use, I think org file is a good place to store all of the quotes.
